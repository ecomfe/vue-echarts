# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

Core source lives in `src/`, implemented in TypeScript with the Vue 3 Composition API. Key entry modules include `src/index.ts` for exports, `src/ECharts.ts` for the main component, and utilities under `src/composables/` and `src/utils.ts`. Demo site assets sit in `demo/` (Vite-powered) and should be kept in sync with new features. Bundled artifacts in `dist/` are generated by `pnpm build`; avoid editing them manually. Shared build helpers reside in `scripts/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use `pnpm install` to set up dependencies. `pnpm dev` serves the demo playground at `http://localhost:5173` for interactive testing. Run `pnpm build` (tsdown) to produce distributable output under `dist/`, and `pnpm dev:build` or `pnpm dev:preview` when you need the Vite bundle for the demo. `pnpm typecheck` validates the libraryâ€™s TypeScript contracts, `pnpm lint` applies ESLint with autofix, `pnpm format` runs Prettier, and `pnpm test` executes the Vitest suite. Use `pnpm publint` before releases to confirm the published surface.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

This project targets Vue 3 + TypeScript with ECMAScript modules. Follow the existing 2-space indentation, trailing commas where valid, and single quotes for strings unless interpolation is required. Components and exported composables use PascalCase (e.g., `VChart`), while local helpers remain camelCase. Honor `eslint.config.ts` and Prettier defaults; always run `pnpm lint && pnpm format` before sending patches. Keep public exports centralized in `src/index.ts` and add accompanying CSS changes to `src/style.css`.

## Testing Guidelines

There is no standalone unit-test runner yet; rely on TypeScript, linting, and manual QA in the demo. Before opening a PR, run `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm build`. Exercise relevant demos in `demo/src/` and add or update examples that showcase new behaviors. For major fixes, include reproduction and verification steps in the PR description so reviewers can follow along.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Commit history follows Conventional Commits (`type(scope): summary`), e.g., `feat(runtime): add renderer option` or `chore(deps): update vue`. Use concise, imperative summaries and group related changes together. PRs should describe user-facing effects, list verification commands, and link issues with `Fixes #123` when applicable. Include screenshots or GIFs for visual updates to the demo, and note any doc changes (`README.md`, `demo/`) in the description. Ensure CI checks mirror local commands: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm build`.
